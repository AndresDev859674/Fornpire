## ü§î What Is Utochou? (EXPLAINED WITH THE CREATOR and some things that will come soon)
the name is not japanese nothing like that, Utochou Executor is a Script runner using cxapi (Cloudy API) and using Xeno API, I try to compete with xeno but obviously not, it uses the same API so no, the executor is new, being new, we do not have the most epic features there are, like artificial intelligence (that will be soon), There may be Solution Updates (fixes injection and some things) Full Updates (Adds new Content and also bug fixes), although the executor does not have much UNC, myself (the creator) am looking for a way to get 94% UNC (I have to do research) I want my executor to have A LOT OF UNC and thus how to break Ronix Executor (it can be a very but VERY COMPLICATED task) but oh well
